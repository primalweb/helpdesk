<title> Your Technology Help Desk </title>

<p>
I'm starting an IT help desk, because my first real job was at an answering service, where I learned excellent customer service skills. And we had basic to advanced accounts, which required digital records processing. 
</p><p>
Over time, I was assigned to one of the advanced accounts, as a union dispatcher, making sure guard check-ins were in compliance with union rules. I grew in familiarity with the system specific to this account, and volunteered to handle backlogged issue tickets. 
</p><p>
This was overstepping a boundary, a barrier placed by the onsite supervisor for the account. But the company owner needed the help, and welcomed my effort. I made steady progress investigating and implementing solutions: from call handling protocol, to isolating coding bugs that were causing glitches. 
</p><p>
For the harder issues, I would explore every possible avenue, in detail, to track down useful information. Then, I would take my considerations to the owner of the company. And based on what I described, he would direct his IT guy, or pull up the code for the account himself, and show me where the problem might be originating, and how he might fix it. 
</p><p>
However, on a business level, I didn't know anything about negotiating for better pay. 
</p><p>
I really loved the work I did though, and soon earned routine accolades, from the whole union, for being the go-to person, to discover win-win situations, in times of conflict. 
</p><p>
I was requested by the union compliance liaison officers, to attend a meeting between the owner of the answering service, and union officials. The owner was surprised at how much authority the officers gave me to contribute ideas during the meeting. 
</p><p>
Eventually, that on-site supervisor, ended up undermining a major improvement I'd made to the account handling protocol, and the company management team allowed her to. 
</p><p>
So, I quit. 
</p><p>
And I found out later, from one of the friends I made at that job, that 
1) when she told the lead union compliance liaison officer that I had quit, he said "What are we going to do without her?" She replied, "I don't know." <br>
2) that same officer told her, the union had offered the owner to pay me $30 an hour (our normal pay was $10/hour, and the company supervisors, who had been there for 10 -15 years, were making $12/hour)!<br>
</p><p>
That was in like 2005. 
</p>
<p>Since then, I've done database management for community service organizations, while in college. Attempted a coding boot camp. And have mentored people, throughout the years, in learning, or doing better with, their technology.
</p>
<p> These days, I study startup culture and programming/coding, while continuing to help people with technology whenever I'm invited to.
